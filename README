The client program must be ran on the cse02 machine

The server must be ran on the cse01 machine

The following server and client programs display a 3 way handshake and closing of a TCP connection

compile the client accordingly...
	gcc -o client client.c

compile the server accordingly...
	gcc -o server pserver.c

to run the server(must be ran first) type ./server <portno>

to run the client, type ./client <portno>


for both codes, there is a structure called tcp_hdr that holds parts of the tcp header.
So for example is holds the source number, destination number, sequence number etc...


When ran, the client sets up its header and sends the request to the server.

The server checks this header, changes its ack number and set the sequence number and sends the response to the client

The client then sends another the structure back to the server to complete the 3 way handshake


For closing, the client sends its header with the FIN flag set

The server reads in the header and sends an ack and a fin flag

Once the client receives both, it sends its header to the server and closes its connection

onces the server receives this header, it closes it's connection



All transmissions and received headers are stored in client.out and server.out respectively.
The header information is displayed and titled if it is trasmitted or received
